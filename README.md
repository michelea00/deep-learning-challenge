# Deep-learning-challenge
# Overview
Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from the application_df DataFrame

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- every other column from the application_df DataFrame

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
-  'EIN' and 'NAME' columns

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-  I used 8 hidden_nodes1 and 5 hidden_nodes2  

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- no, the target did not meet 75%

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

# Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
- the model performance was around 73% accurate in its predictions. i think using a model with better correlation between input and output would likely show better results.
